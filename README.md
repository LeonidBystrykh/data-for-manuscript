Mostly python scripts by biologist for biologists

Details are in the branches

Branch scripts contain scripts for jupyter or colab (.ipynb format)
There are three branches with source files: meta (for differential expression data as reported by authors), rean (for reanalysed by us data) , AS_lists (lists of differentially expressed genes from the aging signature per publication).
